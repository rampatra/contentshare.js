ContentShare is a jQuery plugin which lets you share the exact content on a page which you actually want to share. It enables you to share selected text on your social network rather the default text specified in the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags. By default, it supports Facebook and Twitter but you can add more networks easily.
